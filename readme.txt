A little experiment to incorporate trust factor into AODV (Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector) routing protocol to improve the reliability of data transmissions in mobile ad-hoc networks.

trust_based_aodv:

In this module the actual trust based aodv is simulated. There are four files namely aodv.cpp, trust.cpp, aodv_old.cpp, trust_old.cpp that contains the source code for the application.

Files aodv_out.txt, trust_out.txt, aodv_out_old.txt, trust_out_old.txt that contain the output of the execution for the respective protocols and the io1.txt, io2.txt contain the respective input files. 

traffic_gen:

Generates file containing network traffic details which will be consumed by trust_based_aodv
